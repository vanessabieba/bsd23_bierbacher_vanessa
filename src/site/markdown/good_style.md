# Best Practices for Writing Source Code Comments and Git Commit Messages
## Good Source Code Comments
- Clarity and Relevance: Write clear and concise comments that explain complex or non-intuitive code sections. Avoid redundant or obvious comments.
- Maintainability: Keep comments up-to-date with code changes and remove obsolete comments.
## Good Git Commit Messages
- Structure: Use a short summary (under 50 characters) in the imperative mood, followed by an optional detailed description.
- Clarity and Precision: Be clear and precise about what and why changes were made. Avoid vague descriptions.
